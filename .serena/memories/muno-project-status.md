# MUNO Project Status - Updated 2025-09-04

## Current State
The project has undergone significant refactoring to improve configuration management and code organization.

## Recent Major Changes

### Configuration System Overhaul (COMPLETED)
- Moved from scattered constants to embedded defaults system
- Created `/internal/config/defaults.yaml` with all default values
- Implemented clean override hierarchy: defaults → project config → runtime
- Removed dependency on constants package from core modules
- All configuration now flows through the config package

### Tree Manager Refactoring (COMPLETED EARLIER)
- Separated stateful and stateless managers
- Improved test coverage to >70%
- Clean separation of concerns
- Better error handling and state management

## Code Organization

### Package Structure
```
/internal/
├── config/          # Configuration management (refactored)
│   ├── defaults.yaml    # Embedded default configuration
│   ├── defaults.go      # Configuration structures and merge logic
│   └── tree.go          # Tree-based v3 configuration
├── tree/            # Tree navigation (refactored)
│   ├── manager.go       # Stateful tree manager
│   └── manager_stateless.go # Stateless tree manager
├── manager/         # High-level orchestration
├── constants/       # DEPRECATED - only for legacy code
└── git/            # Git operations
```

### Test Coverage
- tree package: >70% coverage
- config package: Good coverage with new tests
- manager package: Adequate coverage
- Overall: Healthy test coverage

## Configuration Patterns

### Default Values Location
All defaults now in `/internal/config/defaults.yaml`:
- Workspace settings (name, repos_dir)
- Detection patterns (eager_patterns, ignore_patterns)
- File settings (config_names, state_file)
- Git settings (default_branch, default_remote)
- Display settings (tree characters, icons)
- Behavior settings (auto_clone_on_nav, etc.)

### Key Patterns Added
- `-root-repo`: New eager load pattern for root repositories
- `-platform`, `-workspace`: Additional meta-repo patterns

## Outstanding Items

### Potential Improvements
1. Simple environment variable support (without external libs)
2. CLI flag overrides for configuration
3. Configuration validation enhancements
4. Migration tool for old constants usage

### Technical Debt
- Legacy v1/v2 config still uses constants package
- Some test files could be consolidated
- Documentation could be enhanced

## Build and Test Status
✅ All tests passing
✅ Build successful
✅ Custom configuration working
✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Next Development Phase Suggestions
1. Add simple env var support for CI/CD scenarios
2. Create configuration documentation
3. Add configuration schema validation
4. Consider configuration hot-reload for development
