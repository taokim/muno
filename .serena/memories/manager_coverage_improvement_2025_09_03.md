# Manager Package Coverage Improvement
Date: 2025-09-03

## Successful Coverage Improvement
**Final Package Coverage**: 70.3% (achieved target!)
**Previous Coverage**: 56.9%
**Improvement**: +13.4%

## Tests Added
Successfully created comprehensive test file: `internal/manager/manager_v2_operations_test.go`

### Functions Now Tested:
1. **Git Operations**:
   - CloneRepos (recursive and non-recursive)
   - StatusNode (single and recursive status)
   - PullNode (with recursive pull support)
   - PushNode (with recursive push support)
   - CommitNode

2. **Tree Display Functions**:
   - ListNodesRecursive (both recursive and non-recursive listing)
   - ShowCurrent (display current position)
   - ShowTreeAtPath (show tree at specific paths)

3. **Metrics Provider**:
   - NoOpMetricsProvider (Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Timer, Flush)
   - NoOpTimer (Start, Stop, C, Record)

4. **Additional Coverage**:
   - Close method with nil providers
   - Various edge cases and error conditions

## Key Implementation Details
- Used existing mock infrastructure (MockGitProvider, MockTreeProvider, etc.)
- Followed project's mock patterns (SetStatus, SetNode, SetCurrent methods)
- Comprehensive test scenarios including error cases
- Tests verify both success and failure paths

## Result
âœ… **Manager package now meets the 70% coverage target**
The improved test coverage provides better confidence in the manager package's core functionality, especially for git operations and tree navigation features.
