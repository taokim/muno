# Manager Package Coverage Status
Date: 2025-09-03

## Current Status
- **Package Coverage**: 56.9% (decreased from 64.2%)
- **Target**: 80% coverage
- **Gap**: Need +23.1% more coverage

## Work Completed Today
1. Added comprehensive tests for `handlePluginAction` method
   - Improved from 38.5% to 92.3% coverage
2. Added tests for MockProcess methods
   - All methods now at 100% coverage (Wait, Kill, Signal, Pid, StdoutPipe, StderrPipe, StdinPipe)
3. Added tests for nopWriteCloser
   - Write and Close methods at 100% coverage
4. Added tests for InitializeWithConfig edge cases
5. Added tests for ExecutePluginCommand scenarios

## Functions with Low/Zero Coverage
### Zero Coverage (0%):
- Fatal, SetLevel (logging)
- Counter, Gauge, Histogram (metrics)
- Start, C, Reset, Record (metrics timer)

### Very Low Coverage (<20%):
- ListNodesRecursive (13.3%)
- StatusNode (11.1%)
- CloneRepos (10.0%)
- PullNode (13.3%)
- PushNode (13.3%)
- CommitNode (15.4%)
- ShowTreeAtPath (20.0%)

### Low Coverage (<50%):
- ShowCurrent (28.6%)
- Close (50.0%)

## Issue Identified
The additional test file created today overlapped with existing tests, causing a decrease in overall coverage percentage. Many critical functions related to tree display, git operations, and node management remain untested.

## Path to 80% Coverage
To reach 80%, we need to:
1. Add tests for all the tree display functions (ListNodesRecursive, ShowCurrent, ShowTreeAtPath)
2. Add tests for git operation functions (CloneRepos, StatusNode, PullNode, PushNode, CommitNode)
3. Add tests for metrics provider methods
4. Improve Close method coverage

## Recommendation
Focus on testing the high-impact functions that have zero or very low coverage. The git operations and tree display functions would provide the most coverage gain.
