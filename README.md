# Repo-Claude

Transform your multi-repository chaos into a monorepo-like development experience with AI agents.

## The Problem

While Claude and other AI coding assistants excel at working within a single repository, modern software development often spans multiple repositories:
- Microservices architectures with dozens of service repos
- Frontend/backend separation across different repositories  
- Shared libraries and components in separate repos
- Mobile apps alongside web services

**The Challenge**: AI agents struggle to understand and work across repository boundaries, missing critical context and dependencies that span multiple repos.

## The Solution

Repo-Claude brings Google's proven multi-repository management approach (used for Android's 1000+ repos) to AI agent orchestration:

### 1. **Monorepo-Like Organization**
Transform multiple Git repositories into a unified workspace while keeping them separate:
- Single configuration file defines all repositories and their relationships
- Manage dozens of repos with simple commands (`rc sync`, `rc status`)
- Each repo maintains its independence while being part of a cohesive whole

### 2. **Cross-Repository AI Agents**
Enable AI agents to work seamlessly across repository boundaries:
- Agents understand the full system context, not just individual repos
- Shared memory enables coordination between agents working on different repos
- Agents can reference code and dependencies across the entire workspace

> **Inspired by [Google's Repo tool](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/)** - We've adapted Repo's battle-tested multi-repository management concepts for the AI era, creating a monorepo-like experience without the complexity of actual monorepos.

## Features

- 🚀 **Single Binary**: No runtime dependencies (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- 🗂️ **Multi-Repository Management**: Manage dozens of Git repositories as one unified workspace
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple Claude Code instances across repositories

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize a new workspace**:
   ```bash
   rc init my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Start agents**:
   ```bash
   rc start              # Start all auto-start agents
   rc start backend-agent # Start specific agent
   ```

3. **Check status**:
   ```bash
   rc status
   ```

4. **Stop agents**:
   ```bash
   rc stop
   ```

## Example: E-Commerce Platform

Imagine you're building an e-commerce platform with:
- `api-gateway` - API gateway repository
- `user-service` - User authentication service
- `order-service` - Order management service  
- `inventory-service` - Inventory tracking
- `web-frontend` - React web application
- `mobile-app` - React Native mobile app

Without Repo-Claude, AI agents can only see one repository at a time. They miss critical context like:
- How the frontend calls the API gateway
- Shared data models between services
- Authentication flow across services
- Dependencies between order and inventory services

With Repo-Claude, agents work across all repositories simultaneously:
- **Frontend Agent**: Updates web and mobile UI, understanding the full API structure
- **Backend Agent**: Modifies services with awareness of all consumers
- **API Agent**: Maintains gateway with knowledge of all services and clients

All repositories remain separate (different teams can own them), but AI agents see the complete system - just like developers working in a monorepo.

## Configuration

The `repo-claude.yaml` file defines your workspace:

```yaml
workspace:
  name: my-project
  manifest:
    remote_name: origin
    remote_fetch: https://github.com/yourorg/
    default_revision: main
    projects:
      - name: backend
        groups: core,services
        agent: backend-agent
      - name: frontend
        groups: core,ui
        agent: frontend-agent

agents:
  backend-agent:
    model: claude-sonnet-4
    specialization: API development, database design
    auto_start: true
  frontend-agent:
    model: claude-sonnet-4
    specialization: React/Vue development, UI/UX
    auto_start: true
    dependencies: [backend-agent]
```

## Workspace Structure

After running `rc init my-project`, you'll have:

```
my-project/
├── repo-claude.yaml        # Configuration
├── .repo-claude-state.json # Agent state tracking
└── workspace/              # Default workspace directory
    ├── shared-memory.md    # Agent coordination
    ├── .repo/              # Repo metadata
    │   └── manifests/      # Local git repo with manifest
    │       └── default.xml # Repo manifest
    ├── backend/            # Repository (main branch)
    │   └── CLAUDE.md       # Agent context
    └── frontend/           # Repository (main branch)
        └── CLAUDE.md       # Agent context
```

Note: 
- The `rc` command is installed system-wide via Homebrew or manual installation
- Repositories are cloned into the `workspace/` subdirectory by default
- You can customize the workspace path in `repo-claude.yaml` if needed

## Architecture

Repo-Claude uses direct Git operations to manage multiple repositories. Each agent works in its own repository with awareness of other repositories through relative paths and shared memory.

Key components:
- **GitManager**: Handles all Git operations (clone, sync, status)
- **Manager**: Core orchestration logic
- **Config**: YAML configuration and state management
- **Agent**: Claude Code process management

### Inspiration and History

This project was inspired by Google's Android Repo tool, adopting its multi-repository management concepts while simplifying for AI agent orchestration. We initially used Repo directly but found it added unnecessary complexity for our use case.

See our [detailed architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md) and [design decisions](docs/adr/) for more information.

## FAQ

### Why not use Google's Repo tool directly?

We initially used the Android Repo tool but found it incompatible with AI agent workflows for several reasons:

1. **No Root Documentation Support**: Repo's manifest repositories are designed purely for repository structure, not documentation. AI agents need global context documentation at the workspace root, which Repo's manifest-only approach doesn't support well.

2. **Complex Manifest Management**: Repo requires XML manifests in a separate git repository, adding complexity that confuses users who already have a simple YAML configuration.

3. **Unnecessary Features**: Repo's advanced features (branch management, code review upload, cherry-picking) aren't needed for AI agent orchestration.

4. **Heavy Dependencies**: Repo downloads ~30MB of Python scripts per workspace, while our Go implementation is a single 10MB binary.

5. **Poor AI Context Flow**: AI agents typically read documentation from the root directory first to understand the system. Repo's structure, with manifests in a separate repository, breaks this natural context flow.

See [ADR-001](docs/adr/001-simplify-git-management.md) for the detailed technical decision.

### Can I use this without AI agents?

Yes! While designed for AI agent orchestration, repo-claude works great for anyone managing multiple related repositories. Use it for:
- Keeping multiple microservices in sync
- Managing frontend/backend/mobile repos together
- Coordinating shared libraries with their consumers

### How does this compare to Git submodules?

Unlike submodules, repositories managed by repo-claude:
- Remain completely independent (no parent-child relationships)
- Can be at different branches/commits
- Don't require special git commands
- Are easier to work with for both humans and AI agents

### Is this a monorepo?

No, this creates a monorepo-like experience while keeping repositories separate. You get the benefits of unified tooling and visibility without the drawbacks of a true monorepo (huge repository size, complex permissions, slow clones).
