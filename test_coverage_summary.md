# Test Coverage Summary Report

## Current Status (Final Update)

### Package Coverage
| Package | Current Coverage | Target | Status | Gap |
|---------|-----------------|--------|---------|-----|
| internal/config | **87.8%** | 80% | ✅ **Achieved** | +7.8% |
| internal/git | **86.5%** | 80% | ✅ **Achieved** | +6.5% |
| internal/manager | **69.7%** | 80% | ❌ Below target | -10.3% |
| cmd/repo-claude | 37.6% | 80% | ❌ Below target | -42.4% |
| **Overall** | **72.5%** | **80%** | ❌ Below target | **-7.5%** |

### Critical Gaps

#### 1. CLI Package (cmd/repo-claude) - 37.6% coverage
- **main.go:main()** - 0% coverage (critical)
- Command execution tests failing
- Version and help output tests failing

#### 2. Manager Package (internal/manager) - 68.6% coverage
Key uncovered areas:
- **getWindowsProcessInfo** - 0% coverage
- **getUnixProcessInfo** - 21.2% coverage  
- **getSystemMemory** - 35.7% coverage
- **GetAgentLogs** - 55.0% coverage
- **GetProcessInfo** - 60.0% coverage

### Progress Made
✅ Created comprehensive test infrastructure:
- Mock interfaces for external dependencies
- Test files for all major components
- Integration test framework

✅ Achieved target coverage for:
- internal/config (87.8% > 80%)
- internal/git (86.5% > 80%)

### Next Steps to Achieve 80% Overall
1. Fix failing CLI tests (help, version output)
2. Add tests for main() function
3. Improve process info function coverage
4. Add more manager package tests

### Test Execution Issues
- Some tests are skipped due to process execution requirements
- Git operations require mocking to avoid network calls
- Interactive tests need refactoring to accept io.Reader
